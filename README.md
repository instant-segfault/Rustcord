# Rustcord
A work in progress custom Discord client written in Rust.

## Purpose

This project is intended to be a alternative for the Discord client(which uses Electron and React, both slow and memory heavy options) that performs better than the original.
This client will almost never have feature parity, some features may never be implemented.
